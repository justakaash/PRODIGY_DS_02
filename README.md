# PRODIGY_DS_02
My Second Project as a Data Science Intern at Prodigy Infotech.

I was assigned to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
on a dataset of my choice, such as the Titanic dataset from
Kaggle and explore the relationships between variables and
identify patterns and trends in the data.
